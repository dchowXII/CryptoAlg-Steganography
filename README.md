# Cryptographic Algorithms - Steganography Project
Repository for CryptoAlg Steganography Project

Using the research article "Steganographic Model Based on Pixel-Value Differencing and the Perfect Square Number", written by Hsein-Wen Tang and Hui-Shih Leng, we implemented their research to embedding secret messages into an rbga photo. Before we input the secret message into the image we used AES to encrypt the plaintext.

To decrypt we used the decryption method described in the article with a combination of AES decryption to extract the plaintext from the rgba photo.
